# No environment variables required for basic deployment!
# This application uses file-based storage.

# IMPORTANT: On Vercel, file storage is ephemeral
# Data will reset on each deployment
# Consider using persistent storage for production:
# - Vercel KV (Redis)
# - Vercel Postgres  
# - MongoDB Atlas
# - Supabase

# Application will work without any environment variables!
