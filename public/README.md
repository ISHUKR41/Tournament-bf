## Payment QR Code

**IMPORTANT:** Place your payment QR code image here with the filename: `payment-qr.png`

The QR code image you provided should be saved as:
- File path: `public/payment-qr.png`
- Recommended size: 300x300 pixels or larger
- Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG

### How to add the QR code:

1. Save the QR code image from your message
2. Rename it to `payment-qr.png`
3. Copy it to this `public` folder
4. The website will automatically display it on both tournament pages

If the image is not added, you'll see a broken image icon on the payment section.
