## 🔄 Auto-Deploy Setup (Already Working!)

### How It Works:

1. **You push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel auto-detects the push**
   - Connected to your GitHub repository
   - Watches for changes on `main` branch

3. **Vercel auto-builds:**
   - Clones latest code
   - Installs packages
   - Builds website
   - Deploys automatically

4. **Website updates:**
   - New version goes live
   - Old version replaced
   - No manual deploy needed!

### Verify Auto-Deploy is Active:

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Git**

You should see:
- ✅ **Production Branch:** `main`
- ✅ **Auto Deploy:** Enabled
- ✅ **Deploy Hooks:** Active

## 💡 Future Improvements (Optional)

If you want to remove warnings later (not urgent!):

### Upgrade tsparticles to v3:

npm install @tsparticles/react @tsparticles/slim

# Update components/particles-background.tsx
# (This requires code changes)
```

### Upgrade other dependencies:
```bash
npm update
```

**But for now:** Everything works perfectly! No rush to upgrade! ✅
